## Space Mission
Space Mission is a simple but fun Pygame-based arcade game where you pilot a rocket through space, avoiding enemy shuttles for as long as possible. The longer you survive, the higher your score (measured in time).

## Gameplay
* You control a rocket at the bottom of the screen.
* Enemy shuttles spawn from the top and move down toward you.
* Survive as long as possible without colliding with any enemy shuttle.
* Your survival time is displayed in seconds.
